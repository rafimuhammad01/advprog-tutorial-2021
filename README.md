## **TL;DR**

First week of the tutorial:

1. Create a new project on GitLab to store all tutorial work, e.g.
advprog-tutorial-2021

2. Note the clone (HTTPS) URL of the repository on your new project
3. Clone the repository to your local machine
    - `git clone https://gitlab.com/<YOURNAME>/advprog-tutorial-2021.git`
 4. Go to the GitLab project page of this (problem set) tutorial repository
5. Note the clone (HTTPS) URL
6. Back to your local tutorial work repository, add new remote named upstream
that points to this repository:
git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/csui-advprog-2019/advprog-tutorial-2021.git
7. Pull initial problem sets from upstream: git pull upstream master

> If your Git produced an error about 'unrelated histories', try adding
--allow-unrelated-histories option in git pull invocation

8. Push initial problem sets to your own online Git repository on GitLab:
git push -u origin master

9. Tell us your GitLab username and URL to your tutorial work repository

If there are updates from upstream:

1. git pull upstream master
2. Fix any merge conflict(s) that might arise (hopefully none)

      - Always choose latest commit from upstream when fixing merge
        conflict(s)
3. Do not forget to commit your merged master branch and push it
to your own master branch at your GitLab project's repository
    - Use Git command: git push origin master.
 
 
 Working on a tutorial problem set:
 
1. Pull any updates from `upstream`
2. `cd tutorial-n` where **n** is week number folder ID. E.g. **tutorial-2**
3. `git checkout -b tutorial-n master`
4. Do the exercises as instructed in its README.md file
5. Commit your work frequently
6. Write good commit message(s)
7. If your work is ready for grading: `git push -u origin tutorial-n`
8. Make Merge Request (MR) to merge your work branch to `master` and
assign your TA as the assignee

If you want to know the detailed explanation about each instructions above,
please read the following sections.

## Initial Setup

1. Create a new GitLab project for storing all tutorial work, e.g.
`advprog-tutorial`. **This GitLab project and its repository will be
used to store all tutorial work starting from `tutorial-1` next week.**
2. Open the project page and copy the HTTPS clone URL into clipboard
3. Clone the repository into your local machine. Use Git command:
`git clone https://gitlab.com/<YOURNAME>/advprog-tutorial.git <PATH>`
where `<PATH>` is a path to a directory in your local machine.
4. Go to the directory where the cloned repository is located in your
local machine.
5. Add new remote called **upstream** that points to this (problem set)
repository. Use Git command: `git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/csui-advprog-2019/adv-tutorial-2021.git`
6. Pull initial problem sets from `upstream` to your local's `master`:
`git pull upstream master`
7. Push initial commits in your local's `master` to your online GitLab
repository: `git push -u origin master`
8. Tell your TA about your GitLab username and URL to your tutorial
work repository so s/he can grade it later.
9. Ensure that your repository page has visibility level set to
**Internal** or **Public**. Check it in **Edit Project** menu at
your repository page.

## Doing the Tutorial

1. Suppose that you want to work on week 1 problem set. Go to the
directory that containing week 1 problem, i.e. `tutorial-1`.
2. To ensure your work regarding week 1 problem is isolated from
your other attempts at other problems, create a new branch
specifically for working on week 1 problem. Use Git command:
`git checkout -b tutorial-1 master`
    - Explanation: Create a new branch named `tutorial-1` based on 
    latest commit in `master` branch.
3. Read the README file in `tutorial-1` directory. It contains set of
mandatory and optional tasks that you can work on.
4. Do the tutorial.
5. Use `git add` or `git rm` to stage/unstage files that you want to
save into Git later.
6. Once you want to save your progress, commit your work to Git. Use
Git command: `git commit` A text editor will apear where you should
write a commit message. Please try to follow the guidelines written
in [this guide](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to
write a good commit message.
7. Repeat steps 4 - 6 until you finished the tutorial.
8. Once you are ready to submit your work or you want to save it to
your repository on GitLab, do a Git push. The Git command: 
`git push -u origin tutorial-1`
9. If you are ready to be graded by TA, make a Merge Request (MR) via
Merge Request menu on GitLab. Set your tutorial branch as source and
`master` as the target branch for for merging. After that, assign your TA
as the assignee of the MR.

## Pulling Updates From Upstream

If there are any updates from upstream, you can get the latest commits
and integrate it into your fork by using the following Git command:
`git pull upstream master`

Merge conflicts may arise since the repository is updated weekly and
may have overlapping changes with the `master` branch in your own
forked repository. If merge conflict happens, please always use latest
commit from `upstream`. Your works are safe as long you put in in its
own separate branches, e.g. `tutorial-1`, `tutorial-2`, and so forth.

Once you have resolved any merge conflicts and all commits from
upstream are merged succesfully to your own `master` branch, do not
forget to push it back to your own GitLab repository. Use Git command:
`git push origin master`

    
All students required to demonstrate their work to teaching assistant by
using code review. Code review shall be conducted by using Merge
Request on GitLab and offline discussion. Offline discussions only take place during the tutorial session.
Students are expected to follow-up questions and feedback given by TA.
TA will give grade based on student's participation during code review and
offline discussion. Tutorial work that achieved grade A - C will be accepted
by TA and merged into student's `master` branch.

**Warning: students are not allowed to merge their own tutorial branches
to master without TA's supervision and approval. Only members of teaching
team (TAs & lecturers) that allowed to approve/reject a MR made by student.**
